<b>> You</b>: But why ?\
<b>@kurumeii</b>: Ehh~ i was bored af and i have nothing to do so i choose this to kill my boredom and at the same time practicing my skills as a Web Dev. That's all really\
<b>> You</b>: Hmm... Were you THAT bored ? i mean don't you have work to do ?\
<b>@kurumeii</b>: Close. I DO have some stuff to deal with but tbh, i don't want to, i don't like C#, i don't like plain old JavaScript. I am young and i want to exprience new things not some old shit like .net framework 4.5 ???

## Technology

This website was built from [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) as the front end, along side with [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/) and his famous framework [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) as the back end.

### How to start coding
<b>Run</b> `yarn install` to install lint and prettier first\
<b>Then</b>  `cd server && yarn install` to install all necessary node package for server-side\
<b>Next</b>  `cd ../` to go back from server folder, install node packages inside client folder with `cd client && yarn install`\
When everything is done, finally it's time to code babyyy 🌟
